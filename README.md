# Ambiental_C1
First Contract with Ambiental. Our priority is:

1. Identification of ‘domain errors’ (model domains cutting off the floodplain) on composite flood maps.
2. Identification of unstable simulations (on individual sims);
3. Identification of likely flow obstructions in LiDAR DTM;
4. Work on the Flowroute-hydro calibration/sensitivity challenges. 

### Identification of ‘domain errors’
Initial data analysis is in notebook [Data_analysis.ipynb](./Data_analysis.ipynb) and Working solution in [Domain_error_example.ipynb](Domain_error_example.ipynb).

### Identification of unstable simulations
Initial data analysis is in [Instabilities.ipynb](Instabilities.ipynb)
